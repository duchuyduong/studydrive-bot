# studydrive-bot
A bot for boosting your studydrive account

### General information
Studydrive is a platform where students can share lecture notes and ask questions. For interacting with this website you get credits and karma. The idea of this bot is to boost both values by making other accounts like or download your stuff. Therefore you need a main/master account (that account will be boosted) and a few other accounts ("alt-accounts" = "alternative accounts" or short "alts") that will like your stuff. When you create the alts you should use the main-account's reflink to get some extra credits.

**This is just a fun project to play a bit with the api of studydrive. I have no idea if they can detect alts boosting your account. Maybe they will ban you!**

### Features
- download documents
- upvote documents
- upvote answers
- upvote questions
- upvote flashcards
- play flashcards
- joining/leaving the same courses as the main account
- sort courses alphabetically
- boost single document with all alts
- get stats for main account

### Planned Features
- boost random documents/questions/... to make the alts more "legit"
- maybe multi-main-account-support?
